	<h1>Village Square</h1>
	<p>The Village Square is busy with people and carts moving goods through the community. In the center of the square is a large circular fountain with 3 tiers overflowing with water. 
	   The village continues on to the North and to the East. To the West is the old mill. And directly behind Arthur to the South is his home in a row of other similar cottages.
