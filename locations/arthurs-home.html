	<h1>Artuhur's Home</h1>
	<p>Arthur's home is warm and familiar with a fireplace on one wall of his beautifully decorated cabin.  A large rug covers the center of the floor.
	   Wooden furniture fills the room and welcomes visitors to make themselves comfortable.  In a corner next to the fireplace is an ornate chest 
	   containing the learned recipes that Arthur has acquired.
